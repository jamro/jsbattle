This\n// implementation also provides for initalizing the generator with\n// string seeds, or for saving and restoring the state of the generator.\n//\n// On Chrome, this prng benchmarks about 2.1 times slower than\n// Javascript's built-in Math.random().\n\n(function(global, module, define) {\n\nfunction XorGen(seed) {\n  var me = this;\n\n  // Set up generator function.\n  me.next = function() {\n    var w = me.w,\n        X = me.X, i = me.i, t, v;\n    // Update Weyl generator.\n    me.w = w = (w + 0x61c88647) | 0;\n    // Update xor generator.\n    v = X[(i + 34) & 127];\n    t = X[i = ((i + 1) & 127)];\n    v ^= v << 13;\n    t ^= t << 17;\n    v ^= v >>> 15;\n    t ^= t >>> 12;\n    // Update Xor generator array state.\n    v = X[i] = v ^ t;\n    me.i = i;\n    // Result is the combination.\n    return (v + (w ^ (w >>> 16))) | 0;\n  };\n\n  function init(me, seed) {\n    var t, v, i, j, w, X = [], limit = 128;\n    if (seed === (seed | 0)) {\n      // Numeric seeds initialize v, which is used to generates X.\n      v = seed;\n      seed = null;\n    } else {\n      // String seeds are mixed into v and X one character at a time.\n      seed = seed + '\\0';\n      v = 0;\n      limit = Math.max(limit, seed.length);\n    }\n    // Initialize circular array and weyl value.\n    for (i = 0, j = -32; j < limit; ++j) {\n      // Put the unicode characters into the array, and shuffle them.\n      if (seed) v ^= seed.charCodeAt((j + 32) % seed.length);\n      // After 32 shuffles, take v as the starting w value.\n      if (j === 0) w = v;\n      v ^= v << 10;\n      v ^= v >>> 15;\n      v ^= v << 4;\n      v ^= v >>> 13;\n      if (j >= 0) {\n        w = (w + 0x61c88647) | 0;     // Weyl.\n        t = (X[j & 127] ^= (v + w));  // Combine xor and weyl to init array.\n        i = (0 == t) ? i + 1 : 0;     // Count zeroes.\n      }\n    }\n    // We have detected all zeroes; make the key nonzero.\n    if (i >= 128) {\n      X[(seed && seed.length || 0) & 127] = -1;\n    }\n    // Run the generator 512 times to further mix the state before using it.\n    // Factoring this as a function slows the main generator, so it is just\n    // unrolled here.
